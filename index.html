<h2>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h2>
<p>Computer programming languages allow us to place requests in a language that the computer understands for the computer. Just as there are many human-based languages, there is a set of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The language portion of the computer that can be understood is known as "translating binary scripting language into binary language" as "translation". Each language has its own distinct features, from C to Python, although there are similarities between programming languages many times. These languages allow computers to process large and complex areas of knowledge quickly and efficiently. For example, if a person is given a list of random numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and asked to arrange them in ascending order, it could potentially take a significant amount of time and include some errors</p>
