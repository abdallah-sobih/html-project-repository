<h2> Why Learn to Code? The Surprisingly Broad Benefits of Coding:</h2>
<img src="benefits.jpg" alt= "benefits" width="40%">
<ol>
<li>Coding and programming careers have great earning potential
<p>One of the strongest and clearest aspects of learning into programming is the ability to gain programming and programming professionals. The BLS tracks salaries and other important information for the workforce for a variety of jobs.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, the average annual profit for all occupations in 2016 was $ 37,040. * As you can see, jobs with some programming, programming or scripting skills tend to have above average salary.</p>
</li>
<li>Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs
<p>What is the benefit of a strong salary if no one is looking for employment for this position? When it comes to codec related jobs, there are still plenty of opportunities. Compared to the national average of 7 percent growth, you can see that a handful of centers exceed the average. Computer programmers are interesting, but some think these expectations are influenced by computer programming skills that blend in with other related technology roles on demand. While the role is still very valuable, more and more mixed jobs are being introduced into the workforce. You may receive this to a smaller number of "computer programmer" job ads, as well as opportunities that combine programming skills in other job titles.</p>

<li>Coding ability gives new perspective to problem solving
<p>“Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think,” says Adrian Degus, CEO of Nuvro. He goes on to explain that he used to be more prone to solving problems emotionally. But his coding experience has taught him to approach problems logically. “Understanding logic, at a deep level, has improved my problem solving proficiency tenfold,” he adds.

Coding, in its most basic terms, is really just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical guidelines you’ve outlined. Highly complex tasks are essentially a collection of smaller operations once you break them down. This methodical and logic-heavy approach to problem solving can be a boon for figuring out problems beyond a coding challenge.

Hilary Bird, senior developer at Get CenturyLink, agrees with this sentiment, saying learning to code has benefited her personal and professional life by encouraging her to take a step back and approach situations from a logical perspective. “I can break problems down into small, separate parts and figure out how each is affecting the other,” she explains. “This helps me decide what area of the problem to focus on first.”

Coding, in its simplest terms, is actually just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical guidelines you've defined. Very complex tasks are basically a group of smaller processes once they are divided. This systematic and heavy approach to problem solving can be a boon to discovering problems that go beyond the cryptographic challenge. Hillary Bird, the first developer to acquire CenturyLink, agreed with this sentiment, saying that learning to code has benefited her personal and professional lives by encouraging her to take a step back and deal with situations from a logical perspective. "I can divide problems into separate small parts and see how they are on each other," she explains. "This helps me decide which problem area to focus on first.</p>

<li>Learning to code can be a fun bonding opportunity for families
<p>How often do you have the opportunity to learn something practical and new with your kids? Parents with school-aged children have the chance to start from square one together as they learn the fundamentals of programming and coding.

“My 10-year-old son actually decided to learn to code around the same time I did,” Degus says. “It was a challenging but very rewarding experience. To this day my son and I talk coding over the dinner table, while the rest of the family makes fun of us for being geeks.”

One excellent way to test the waters of learning to code is to practice with kid-friendly resources like Scratch, which gives both you and your child an introduction to programming fundamentals and systemic reasoning. This fundamental understanding will help you as you move on to more complex languages and applications.

<li>Coding can be useful in jobs you might not expect
<p>You might think that programming and programming skills are only valuable to people who work in specialized, high-tech jobs. While it is true that learning coding is more important for some roles, this does not mean that you cannot find ways to process recognition in unencrypted functions. Mark Pelion, chief executive and chief software engineer of bankruptcy anywhere, says his knowledge of programming has benefited him in unexpected ways as a businessman. Billion explains: "We were able to use Python to encrypt our advertising algorithms, which also saved us about $ 1,000 per month." "So if you are in business - any type of business - coding is crucial." The coding ability allowed Billion to automate menial tasks that eventually saved him money. This is a big plus for small businesses where budgets are usually very tight. For those who work closely with programmers and developers, learning the basics of coding can make you a more valuable member of the team. "Although I am primarily a marketer, having technical knowledge is one of the biggest assets I can offer my team," says Jake Lynn, director of growth for Press Detergents. "The ability to make a change in the code base helps free our developers to focus on the most important things and reduce development delay time." You don't have to be a programming expert to reap the benefits of learning to program. Knowing enough to be useful can still be an advantage in most business environments.
