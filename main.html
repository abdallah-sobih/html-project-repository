<h2>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h2>
<p>Computer programming languages allow us to give orders to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages which programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The part of the language which a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, although many times there are commonalities between programming languages.

These languages allow computers to process large and complex swaths of information quickly and efficiently. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.</p>
