<h2>The most common programming languages</h2>
<ol>
<li>JavaScript
<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise when you see JavaScript at the top of almost every modern list of the most common programming languages. Thanks to its continued  integration into the latest open source projects, JavaScript has experienced a massive growth many of us old folks never anticipated. There’s more than one driving factor behind this recent trend of using JavaScript in open source projects.</p>
<img src="JavaScript.jpg" alt="JavaScript" width="40%">
<p>With the inception of the infamous Node JS runtime, developers can employ this language in both the frontend and backend of their projects. In addition, over than 94.9% of all websites currently use JavaScript. So, it opens up new possibilities every day to develop something extraordinary. Meaning, most web developers are embracing JavaScript, once seen as a redundant language for their latest open source contributions. With the increasing momentum of JavaScript, today is considered among the most popular programming languages.</p>
</li>
<li>Python
<p>One of the most used programming languages of our time, Python continues to maintain its ground among open source contributors and will not disappear soon. Python, as a full-fledged language, can be employed into many different types of projects including but not limited to developing APIs, crawlers, scrapers, backend systems, and so on. You can even develop complex desktop applications using this popular dialect of computer languages.
</p>
<img src="Python.jpg" alt="Python" width="40%">
<p>Python is being heavily incorporated in machine learning and data analytics, thanks to a large number of top-notch plugins and third-party libraries. Libraries like SciPY and Panda have a massive fanbase and are exceptionally popular in the industry. It’s this availability of handy third-party libraries that make Python one of the most popular programming languages today. Although not dimmed suitable for handling applications that require low-level manipulation of the system, you can use this language for almost every type of open source projects.</p>
</li>
<li>Java
<p>One of the best programming language to ever walk the console of open source developers, Java is still relevant to the community like it was decades ago. Since its emergence in the early 90s, Java has maintained its position as one of the most popular programming languages, and for good reasons.</p>
<img src="java.png" alt="java" width="40%"height="250px">
<p>The JVM(Java Virtual Machine) paradigm employed in Java makes sure any software written with this language will run on virtually every system. Other top programming languages often unmatch Java’s ability to scale even the most extensive applications.

With one of the largest developer community, Java is undoubtedly going to retain its position as one of the top programming languages for years to come. Industries usually always pay extra attention to Java developers. So, developing a revolutionary open source application using it will bring you in front of the enormous limelight. That’s why a large number of new open source developers side with Java for building their next dream project.</p>
</li>
<li>C++
    <p>The sequel to C, the pioneer of the modern world’s most used programming languages, C++ is not going to be redundant in decades to come. Every complex system in the world starting from your operating system to large government mainframe, utilize C++ in one form or the other.</p>
<img src="C++.png" alt="C++" width="40%">
<p>Even Google uses this language to power its most resource intensive operations. As C++ gives developers access to very low-level system components out of the box, it is used extensively in every type of embedded systems we’re familiar with.

As embedded systems like IoT devices and smartwatches continue to rise in popularity, C++ is going to be used much more in the future. If you’re a developer looking to break in this industry, only C++ can aid you to your most anticipated breakthrough.

Moreover, if you’re looking to build complex open source systems that solve modern day problem, you won’t get anything that delivers a better result than C++, one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
</li>
<li>Swift
    <p>Considering it’s a much newer language than some other picks, Swift is going very strong these recent years. The massive boost experienced by Swift, one of the latest programming languages is due to the convenience it offers to open source developers. The language behind most modern iOS applications, Swift has a lot to offer regarding developing high-tech open source projects.</p>
<img src="download.jpg" alt="Swift" width="40%" height="250px">
<p>The scope of building iOS apps has contributed heavily to an increasing number of Swift developers as Apple’s iPhone continues to retain its position as one of the best mobile smartphones to date.

Swift is obvious to understand and is very expressive. It enables even the newest developers to power flexible and modern iOS applications. So, we can’t but anticipate a bright future for this awe-inspiring programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>Ruby
    <p>One of the most used programming languages of this generation, Ruby was developed in the mid-90s but gained most of its notoriety during the last decades or so. It is an interpreted, dynamic, and object-oriented language, much like Python and even feels the same in many aspects.</p>
<img src="Ruby.jpg" alt="Ruby" width="40%">
<p>With the inception of powerful web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Sinatra, Ruby started to power most of the modern web apps before losing the spotlight to JavaScript stacks. Many famous modern web apps such as Github, Airbnb, ASKfm, Goodreads, and Fiverr utilize ruby in one way or another.

Popular open source projects that employ Ruby include Homebrew, Discourse, Metasploit Framework, and many more. So, Ruby is the language to learn if you want to start contributing to big open source projects right from today.</p>
</li>
<li>PHP
    <p>Although it lost its once reining position as the de-facto programming language for the web, PHP is still one of the most used programming languages around the globe. As there was no web language comparable to PHP during the internet’s rapid growth, PHP fueled almost every modern website until the emergence of newer web languages like JavaScript and Ruby.</p>
<img src="Php.jpg" alt="PHP" width="40%">
<p>Even as we speak, PHP is behind more than 40% of the total number of active websites, thanks to a continuously increasing number of websites utilizing CMS’s like WordPress and Drupal. So if you think PHP is dead, you’re quite wrong. Although experiencing relatively less limelight, PHP will continue to evolve for years to come and retain its position as one of the most popular programming languages.

When developing your next open source web project, if you’re looking for a programming language that has dynamic capabilities blended accurately with powerful database manipulation features, PHP should always be on your preferred list.</p>
</li>
<li>C#
    <p>C# is the best programming language from the software behemoth Microsoft. It’s one of the top multi-paradigm computer programming languages that can be used for many different projects. Although primarily intended for Microsoft’s .NET framework, C# rapidly took on other demanding computational challenges and became one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
<img src="c-sharp.jpg" alt="C#" width="40%" height="250px">
<p>The language itself is simple and modern, with the ability to let developers take an object-oriented approach absent in C. You can think of C# as a blend of the C++ and the Java language. C# codes compile like C++ codes and have syntax like Java. So, if you’re a programmer with adequate knowledge of Java who wants his applications to be as fast as C++ applications, C# is definitely the route to take.

One of the best reason to side with C# for your next open source project is that it gives you the ability to craft any application you want. Starting from complex web APIs to full-fledged desktop applications, C# broadens developer’s toolbelt and can aid him a higher position in the open source community.</p>
