  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1883</td>
    <td>Analytical Engine Algorithm: Ada Lovelace used it in Charles Babbage's analytical engines to calculate Bernoulli numbers, and you are the first computer programming language.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1949</td>
    <td>Assembly language: It is used for the first time widely in the automatic calculator to store electronic delay, assembly language is a type of low-level computer programming language that simplifies the language of the device code, and the specific instructions needed to tell the computer what to do.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1952</td>

The first was developed by Alick Glennie for Computer Mark 1 at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, and some consider automatic code to be the first batch computer programming language, which means that it can be translated directly into device code using a program called translator.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1957</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1958</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1959</td>
    <td> COBOL: was used by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper as a computer programming language that can run on all brands and types of computers. It is used in ATMs, credit card processing, telephone systems, hospital and government computers, automobile systems and traffic lights. In The Terminator, portions of the COBOL source code were used to display Terminator vision</td> 
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>1964</td>
    <td> BASIC: It was developed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College College so that students who do not have a strong technical or mathematical understanding can use computers, which is an abbreviation for all-purpose instruction code for beginners. A modified version of BASIC. This was to become the first Microsoft product.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1970</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1972</td>
    <td>C: Developed by Dennis Richie at Bell Labs, C is the first language to be high-level. The high-level computer programming language is closer to the human language and more removed from the device code. C was created so that an operating system called Unix can be used on many different types of computers. It affected many other languages, including Ruby, C #, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP and Python.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1972</td>
    <td> SQL: SQL was developed by Donald D. Chamberlain and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM. SQL refers to the structured query language. It is used to view and change information stored in databases. SQL uses query-known query statements to add, remove, or display data.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1978</td>
    <td> MATLAB: Developed by Cleve Moler. Matlab stands for Matrix Lab. It is one of the best computer programming languages for writing mathematical programs and is mainly used in mathematics, research and education. It can also be used for 2D and 3D graphics.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1983</td>
    <td> C ++: C ++ is an extension of C language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is one of the most widely used languages in the world. C ++ is used in game drivers and high-performance programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Most of the packed programs are still written in C ++.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1987</td>
    <td> Perl: Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a programming language designed to edit text. Its purpose was to facilitate the processing of reports. It is now widely used for many purposes, including Linux system administration, web development, and network programming.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1991</td>

It is used for computer types and technology is much different today than it was when languages like C ++, Java and Python were introduced, problems arose when huge computer systems became common. The purpose of the go was to improve the work environment for programmers so they went on writing, reading and maintaining software more efficiently.</td>
